## 1. Introduction

### Planet Wars Game
Planet Wars is a turn-based strategy game where players control fleets of ships to conquer planets. The game involves complex decision-making regarding resource allocation, fleet deployment, and strategic targeting. It's a popular benchmark for AI and computational intelligence techniques.
* *(TODO: Briefly mention if your project uses a specific variant or engine of Planet Wars, or if it's a custom implementation.)*

### Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. It mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanisms of grey wolves in nature, employing alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolves to guide the search for optimal solutions. GWO is known for its simplicity, few parameters, and effectiveness in various optimization problems.

---

## 2. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy of the Grey Wolf Optimizer in developing adaptive and robust strategies for the Planet Wars game. This involves:
* Implementing the GWO algorithm to navigate the complex search space of Planet Wars strategies.
* Optimizing key strategic parameters, such as [TODO: e.g., target planet selection, fleet dispatch ratios, defensive postures - specify what your GWO optimizes].
* Providing a visual interface (via `main.html`) to observe the game play and potentially the optimization process.
* Supporting the findings and methodologies presented in our accompanying research article.

---

## 3. Features

* Implementation of the Grey Wolf Optimizer tailored for strategic decision-making in Planet Wars.
* A Planet Wars game simulation environment (likely JavaScript-based).
* A web-based interface (`main.html`) for visualization and interaction.
* [TODO: Add more specific features, e.g., configurable GWO parameters, different game maps, performance logging, comparison against other strategies if applicable].

## 4. Technical Overview

### Algorithm: GWO for Planet Wars

The GWO algorithm is adapted to solve the Planet Wars strategy problem. This typically involves:

1.  **Solution Encoding:** Defining how a "strategy" or a set of game parameters is represented as a "wolf" (a potential solution) in the GWO search space.
    * *(TODO: Briefly explain your solution encoding. What parameters does each wolf represent?)*
2.  **Fitness Function:** Designing a fitness function to evaluate the effectiveness of a given strategy (wolf). This could be based on metrics like planets conquered, net ship count, or win/loss ratio against a benchmark opponent.
    * *(TODO: Describe your fitness function. How is a strategy's quality quantified?)*
3.  **GWO Operators:** Applying the GWO's social hierarchy (alpha, beta, delta wolves) and hunting behaviors (searching, encircling, attacking prey) to iteratively improve the population of strategies.
    * The alpha wolf represents the best strategy found so far.
    * Beta and delta wolves guide the other omega wolves towards promising areas of the search space.
4.  **Stopping Criteria:** Defining when the optimization process terminates (e.g., a fixed number of generations, convergence of solutions).

*(TODO: You might want to add a small flowchart or pseudocode here if it helps clarify the GWO application in your specific context, especially if detailed in your article.)*

### Simulation Environment

The Planet Wars game appears to be simulated within a web environment, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* `main.html` likely serves as the entry point to launch the simulation.
* The `js/` directory should contain the core logic for the game engine, GWO implementation, and UI interactions.
    * *(TODO: Mention any key JavaScript files or modules if appropriate, e.g., `gwo.js`, `planet_wars_engine.js`, `ui_controller.js`)*

---

## 5. Technology Stack

* **Frontend/Simulation:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **GWO Implementation:** JavaScript
* **Visualization:** [TODO: Mention any specific JS libraries used for graphics or charts, e.g., p5.js, Chart.js, or custom canvas rendering]
* **Development Environment:** `.idea` folder suggests a JetBrains IDE (e.g., WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA).

## 7. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.
* [TODO: List any other prerequisites if applicable, e.g., a local web server for certain JavaScript features, though often not needed for simple HTML/JS projects.]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/parhamzm/Planet-Wars_GWO.git](https://github.com/parhamzm/Planet-Wars_GWO.git)
    cd Planet-Wars_GWO
    ```
2.  No further installation steps (like package managers) are typically required for a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project unless you are using specific frameworks or tools (e.g., Node.js for a build process).
    * *(TODO: If you use npm, yarn, or other package managers, add installation instructions here, e.g., `npm install`)*

### Running the Simulation/Optimizer

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Open the `main.html` file in your web browser.
    * You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with..." your preferred browser.
    * Alternatively, if you are running a local web server, navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:PORT/main.html`).

*(TODO: Add any specific instructions on how to start the GWO process or a game simulation from the UI, if not immediately obvious.)*

---

## 8. Configuration

The GWO algorithm and the Planet Wars simulation might have configurable parameters.
* **GWO Parameters:** Such as population size, number of iterations/generations, coefficients (a, A, C). These might be adjustable via the UI or directly in a JavaScript configuration file (e.g., `js/config.js` or at the top of `gwo_optimizer.js`).
* **Game Parameters:** Such as map selection, number of planets, starting ship counts, game speed for visualization.

*(TODO: Specify where and how these parameters can be configured. Is there a UI for this, or do users need to edit a specific JS file? Provide examples if possible.)*

---

## 9. Interpreting Results

The project aims to find optimal strategies for Planet Wars. Results can be interpreted by:
* Observing the behavior of the GWO-controlled player in `main.html`.
* Analyzing the fitness values of the alpha wolf (best strategy) over generations.
* [TODO: Specify how performance is measured and displayed. Are there charts, logs, or specific metrics shown in the UI? How does this relate to the claims in your article?]
* Comparing the performance of the GWO-optimized strategy against baseline or other AI strategies (if implemented).

---
